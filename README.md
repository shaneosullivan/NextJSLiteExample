== NextJS Lite Example ==

This is a simple example project of one way to use NextJS with

- Server side only rendering
- No ReactJS or NextJS on the client's browser
- A minimal amount of JavaScript on the client's browser
- A simple build system that supports Typescript to create the client side only code

It's certainly not production ready, but feel free to use it as the beginning of your project.
